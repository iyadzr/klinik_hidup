# Docker Version Alignment - Issue Resolution

## Problem Statement
The application was experiencing stubborn unresolved issues due to version inconsistencies between local development and production environments. Local was using newer, potentially unstable Docker versions while production was using different versions, causing unpredictable behavior.

## Version Inconsistencies Found

### Before Alignment:
- **Local System**: Docker 27.4.0, Docker Compose 2.31.0 (newer, potentially fragile)
- **Container Images**:
  - Node.js: Mixed versions (18-alpine and 20-alpine in different Dockerfiles)
  - Nginx: Unversioned `nginx:alpine` (unpredictable updates)
  - PHP: Correctly versioned at 8.3-fmp-alpine
  - MySQL: Correctly versioned at 8.0

### After Alignment:
- **Target Versions** (stable, tested versions):
  - Docker: 27.3.1
  - Docker Compose: 2.29.7
  - Node.js: 20-alpine (LTS) consistently across all containers
  - Nginx: 1.25-alpine (specific stable version)
  - PHP: 8.3-fmp-alpine (maintained)
  - MySQL: 8.0 (maintained)

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Docker Version Alignment Script
- **File**: `scripts/docker-version-align.sh`
- **Purpose**: Automated version standardization across environments
- **Features**:
  - Version checking and reporting
  - Automated Dockerfile standardization
  - Backup creation before changes
  - Version verification scripts

### 2. Updated Dockerfiles
- **Frontend**: Node.js 18-alpine â†’ Node.js 20-alpine
- **Nginx**: nginx:alpine â†’ nginx:1.25-alpine  
- **PHP**: Maintained existing PHP 8.3-fmp-alpine

### 3. Created Supporting Scripts
- `scripts/verify-docker-versions.sh` - Version verification
- `scripts/install-docker-versions.sh` - Aligned Docker installation
- `scripts/rebuild-aligned.sh` - Clean rebuild with aligned versions

### 4. Updated Makefile
Added new targets for version management:
- `make version-check` - Check version alignment
- `make version-align` - Apply version alignment
- `make rebuild-aligned` - Rebuild with aligned versions
- `make install-docker-aligned` - Install aligned Docker versions

## Results

### âœ… Success Indicators:
1. **All containers running healthy**: No startup failures
2. **Application responding**: HTTP 200 status
3. **No error logs**: Clean application logs with only debug messages
4. **Consistent builds**: Reproducible builds across environments

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits:
1. **Predictable behavior** across development and production
2. **Reduced debugging time** from version-related issues
3. **Automated version management** through scripts
4. **Easy maintenance** with version verification tools

## Usage Instructions

### For Regular Development:
```bash
# Check if versions are aligned
make version-check

# Start development with aligned versions
make dev

# Rebuild if needed
make rebuild-aligned
```

### For Production Deployment:
```bash
# Deploy with aligned versions
make deploy-prod-rebuild

# Verify versions in production
./scripts/verify-docker-versions.sh
```

### For New Team Members:
```bash
# Install aligned Docker versions
./scripts/install-docker-versions.sh

# Verify installation
./scripts/verify-docker-versions.sh
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **Regular Version Checks**: Run `make version-check` before major deployments
2. **Update Schedule**: Review and update target versions quarterly
3. **Documentation**: Keep this document updated when target versions change
4. **Team Communication**: Ensure all team members use aligned versions

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after version alignment:
1. Run full rebuild: `./scripts/rebuild-aligned.sh`
2. Check container logs: `make logs`
3. Verify versions: `./scripts/verify-docker-versions.sh`
4. For persistent issues, consider updating target versions in the alignment script
