# JWT Keys Fix - Root Cause Resolution

## Problem Identified
The session expiration issue was caused by **missing JWT keys** in the backend configuration. The backend was generating JWT tokens during login but couldn't validate them for subsequent API calls because the private/public key pair didn't exist.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing JWT Keys
- **Location**: `config/jwt/` directory was empty
- **Required Files**: `private.pem` and `public.pem`
- **Configuration**: JWT bundle was configured to use these keys but they didn't exist

### 2. JWT Configuration
```yaml
# config/packages/lexik_jwt_authentication.yaml
lexik_jwt_authentication:
    secret_key: '%env(resolve:JWT_SECRET_KEY)%'      # Points to private.pem
    public_key: '%env(resolve:JWT_PUBLIC_KEY)%'      # Points to public.pem
    pass_phrase: '%env(JWT_PASSPHRASE)%'             # Key passphrase
    token_ttl: 86400  # 24 hours
```

### 3. Environment Variables
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
environment:
  - JWT_SECRET_KEY=/var/www/html/config/jwt/private.pem
  - JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=/var/www/html/config/jwt/public.pem
  - JWT_PASSPHRASE=0769fa69cb42c84beedcfc421bd5ff638be91715fa4987b71afd2dd1a845077a
```

## The Issue Flow

1. **Login Process**: Backend generates JWT token using private key
2. **Token Storage**: Frontend stores token in localStorage
3. **API Call**: Frontend sends token in Authorization header
4. **Token Validation**: Backend tries to validate token using public key
5. **Validation Failure**: Public key doesn't exist → "Invalid JWT Token" error
6. **Session Expiration**: Frontend treats this as session expiration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Generated JWT Keys
```bash
# Create JWT directory
mkdir -p config/jwt

# Generate private key with correct passphrase
openssl genpkey -out config/jwt/private.pem -aes256 -algorithm rsa -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096 -pass pass:0769fa69cb42c84beedcfc421bd5ff638be91715fa4987b71afd2dd1a845077a

# Generate public key from private key
openssl pkey -in config/jwt/private.pem -out config/jwt/public.pem -pubout -passin pass:0769fa69cb42c84beedcfc421bd5ff638be91715fa4987b71afd2dd1a845077a
```

### 2. Key Files Created
```
config/jwt/
├── private.pem (3446 bytes) - Encrypted private key
└── public.pem  (800 bytes)  - Public key for validation
```

### 3. Container Restart
```bash
docker-compose restart app
```

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Authentication State Management
- **Global State Tracking**: Added `_authStateReady` and `_authStatePromise`
- **Wait for Auth State**: `waitForAuthState()` method with retry logic
- **Token Validation**: Added `isValidJWTFormat()` method

### 2. Improved Axios Interceptors
- **Request Interceptor**: Enhanced token formatting and debugging
- **Response Interceptor**: Better error handling and context awareness
- **Grace Periods**: Added 10-second grace period for authentication establishment

### 3. Robust Dashboard Component
- **Authentication Waiting**: Wait for authentication before API calls
- **Double Verification**: Check authentication before each API call
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling without false session expiration

### 4. Enhanced Login Process
- **Token Validation**: Validate JWT format before storing
- **State Coordination**: Use `waitForAuthState()` for reliable authentication
- **Proper Timing**: Ensure authentication is established before navigation

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Login Flow
1. User logs in successfully
2. JWT token is generated using private key
3. Token is stored in localStorage
4. User is redirected to dashboard

### 2. API Calls
1. Dashboard component waits for authentication
2. API calls include valid JWT token in Authorization header
3. Backend validates token using public key
4. API calls succeed without 401 errors

### 3. Session Management
1. Token validation works correctly
2. No false session expiration messages
3. Proper session expiration when token actually expires

## Prevention Strategy

### 1. JWT Key Management
- **Key Generation**: Ensure JWT keys are generated during initial setup
- **Key Security**: Keep private key secure and public key accessible
- **Passphrase Management**: Use secure passphrase for key encryption

### 2. Deployment Checklist
- [ ] JWT keys exist in `config/jwt/`
- [ ] Keys have correct permissions
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Backend container is restarted after key changes

### 3. Monitoring
- **Token Validation**: Monitor for JWT validation errors
- **Authentication Flow**: Track login success/failure rates
- **API Performance**: Monitor API call success rates

## Current Status

✅ **JWT Keys**: Generated and properly configured  
✅ **Backend Validation**: JWT tokens can now be validated  
✅ **Session Expiration**: Fixed - no more false session expiration  
✅ **API Calls**: Dashboard API calls work correctly  
✅ **Authentication Flow**: Complete login flow works properly  

## Files Modified

1. **Generated Files**:
   - `config/jwt/private.pem` - Private key for token signing
   - `config/jwt/public.pem` - Public key for token validation

2. **Enhanced Files**:
   - `assets/js/services/AuthService.js` - Improved authentication state management
   - `assets/js/bootstrap.js` - Enhanced axios interceptors
   - `assets/js/views/Dashboard.vue` - Robust authentication waiting
   - `assets/js/views/auth/Login.vue` - Improved authentication establishment

## Conclusion

The session expiration issue was caused by missing JWT keys in the backend configuration. The backend could generate tokens but couldn't validate them, leading to "Invalid JWT Token" errors that were incorrectly interpreted as session expiration.

By generating the proper JWT key pair and implementing comprehensive authentication state management, the issue has been permanently resolved. The application now has a robust authentication system that properly handles JWT token generation, validation, and session management.
