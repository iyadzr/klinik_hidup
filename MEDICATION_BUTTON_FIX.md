# Add Medication Button & Asset Loading Issues - FIXED

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Add Medication Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "Add Medication" button was not responding to clicks.

**Root Cause**: The button was inside a form with `@submit.prevent="saveConsultation"` which could interfere with click events, even though the button had `type="button"`.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `@click.stop` to prevent event bubbling: `@click.stop="addMedicationRow"`
- This ensures the click event doesn't bubble up to the form and interfere with the button's functionality

**Code Change**:
```vue
<!-- Before -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" @click="addMedicationRow">

<!-- After -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" @click.stop="addMedicationRow">
```

### 1.1. Review MC Button Not Working
**Problem**: The "Review MC" button was also not responding to clicks.

**Root Cause**: Same issue - the button was inside the same form and needed event bubbling prevention.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `@click.stop` to prevent event bubbling: `@click.stop="showMCPreview"`

**Code Change**:
```vue
<!-- Before -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info btn-sm" @click="showMCPreview">

<!-- After -->
<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info btn-sm" @click.stop="showMCPreview">
```

### 2. Asset Loading Issues Persist Despite Dynamic Loading

**Problem**: Even with dynamic asset loading via `webpack_js_assets()` and `webpack_css_assets()`, old cached assets were still being served.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Browser Cache**: Browser was caching old HTML/JS files
2. **Webpack Dev Server Cache**: Webpack had cached compilation results
3. **Docker Container State**: Containers retained cached state

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Complete Container Restart**: `docker-compose down` followed by `docker-compose up -d`
2. **Cache Clearing**: Removed all cache directories:
   - `node_modules/.cache` (webpack cache)
   - `public/build` (build artifacts)
   - `var/cache` (Symfony cache)
3. **Fresh Build**: Webpack recompiled everything with new hashes

**Evidence of Fix**:
- Vendor file hash changed from `874722` to `23b071`
- All assets now return HTTP 200
- Dynamic asset loading working correctly

## Why Dynamic Assets Still Had Issues

The dynamic asset loading system was correctly implemented:

```php
// AssetService.php - Correctly reads entrypoints.json
public function getWebpackAssets(): array
{
    $entrypointsFile = $this->projectDir . '/public/build/entrypoints.json';
    // ... reads actual webpack-generated files
}
```

```twig
<!-- base.html.twig - Correctly uses dynamic loading -->
{% for jsFile in webpack_js_assets() %}
    <script src="{{ jsFile }}" defer></script>
{% endfor %}
```

**However**, multiple layers of caching meant that:
1. **Webpack dev server** was serving old cached bundles
2. **Browser** was caching the old asset references
3. **Container state** preserved old compilation artifacts

## Prevention Strategy

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Hard Refresh**: Use Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R to bypass browser cache
2. **Clear Webpack Cache**: `rm -rf node_modules/.cache` when assets seem stale
3. **Container Restart**: `docker-compose restart node` for webpack issues
4. **Full Reset**: Complete docker-compose down/up for persistent issues

## Current Status

✅ **Add Medication Button**: Working correctly with `@click.stop`  
✅ **Review MC Button**: Working correctly with `@click.stop`  
✅ **Asset Loading**: Fresh compilation with correct hashes  
✅ **Dynamic Loading**: System working as designed  
✅ **All Containers**: Running successfully

## Technical Notes

- The dynamic asset loading system was never broken - it was correctly reading the manifest
- The issue was that the manifest itself contained references to cached/stale assets
- A complete cache clear and rebuild resolved the asset hash mismatches
- The `.stop` modifier on click events prevents form interference in Vue.js
